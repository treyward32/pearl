# Pearl Miner

Mining infrastructure for the Pearl network. Currently only mining via vLLM is supported, in the future we hope to supply plugins for other LLM inference libraries, like SGLang, TensorRT-LLM, Ollama, ...

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.12
- [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) package manager
- CUDA toolkit and NVIDIA GPU (for `pearl-gemm` and running the miner)
- Rust toolchain (for `py-pearl-mining` dependencies)

## Build

All packages are managed as a uv workspace. Run the following from the **repository root**:

```bash
# Install all packages
uv sync

# Install only vllm-miner and its transitive dependencies
uv sync --package vllm-miner
```

The `pearl-gemm` CUDA kernels are compiled automatically during sync. Set the `PEARL_GEMM_FORCE_BUILD` environment variable to `TRUE` to force a rebuild, or set `PEARL_GEMM_SKIP_CUDA_BUILD=TRUE` to skip the CUDA build entirely.

## Tests

All commands run from the **repository root**. Use `-n auto` to run tests in parallel (requires `pytest-xdist`).

> **GPU requirement:** `pearl-gemm` and `vllm-miner` tests require an NVIDIA GPU. Currently only **sm90** (H100 / H200) GPUs are supported.

### Basic tests

Run the fast, self-contained unit tests (excludes `slow`, `integration`, `performance` markers and the vLLM execution suite):

```bash
uv run pytest -n auto \
  -m "not slow and not integration and not performance" \
  --ignore=miner/vllm-miner/tests/test_vllm_execution.py \
  miner/
```

To run tests for a single package:

```bash
uv run pytest -n auto miner/miner-base/tests/
uv run pytest -n auto miner/pearl-gateway/tests/
uv run pytest -n auto miner/pearl-gemm/tests/
uv run pytest -n auto miner/vllm-miner/tests/ \
  --ignore=miner/vllm-miner/tests/test_vllm_execution.py
```

### Slow tests

Tests marked `slow` typically take >30 seconds (large model loads, extended GPU workloads):

```bash
uv run pytest -n auto -m slow miner/
```

### Performance tests

Throughput and latency benchmarks:

```bash
uv run pytest -m performance miner/
```

### vLLM execution tests

End-to-end tests that start a full vLLM server with the Pearl plugin. These are heavyweight and run sequentially:

```bash
uv run pytest -v miner/vllm-miner/tests/test_vllm_execution.py
```

### Integration tests

Integration tests require a **local `pearld` node** running in simnet mode. See [`.github/workflows/integration_tests_ci.yml`](.github/workflows/integration_tests_ci.yml) for a full working example (node startup flags, environment variables, test invocation).

```bash
uv run pytest -v -m integration miner/
```

## Docker

### Build

Run from the **repository root** (the Dockerfile expects the full monorepo as build context):

```bash
docker buildx build -t vllm_miner . -f miner/vllm-miner/Dockerfile
```

### Run

The container starts `pearl-gateway` in the background and then launches `vllm serve`.

```bash
docker run --rm -it --gpus all \
  -p 8000:8000 -p 8337:8337 -p 8339:8339 \
  -e PEARLD_RPC_URL=<PEARLD URL> \
