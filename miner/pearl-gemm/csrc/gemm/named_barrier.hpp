// Enum of NamedBarriers to avoid conflicts
// These are CTA-wide barriers with a modifiable arrival count, wrapping PTX "bar" instructions
// There are 16, of which CUTLASS currently reserves 8. We need more than 8 so we cast to
// CUTLASS's reserved barrier type in the kernels.
// CUTLASS recommends not to use barrier id 0 as this can conflict with CUDA driver APIs.
